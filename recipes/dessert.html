        There is a nostalgia in the cream rolls. For a very long time, these cones of flaky pastry filled with cream ruled the Indian bakeries. Today you will find a thousand options to choose from, as the bakeries are packed with new products influenced by the western market. But there was a time only fewer items were seen on the shelves of glass cased display of bakeries.
